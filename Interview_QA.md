# Technical Interview Questions and Answers for Prompt Analyzer Project

---

## 1. What is the main purpose of this project?
**Answer:**
The project analyzes user-written prompts for AI systems, providing structured feedback and scoring to help users write better prompts.

---

## 2. What technologies are used in the frontend and backend?
**Answer:**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS (with modern design), and vanilla JavaScript.
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js, using the Google Generative AI (Gemini) API for analysis.

---

## 3. How does the frontend communicate with the backend?
**Answer:**
The frontend sends a POST request with the prompt to the backend’s `/analyze` endpoint using the Fetch API. The backend processes the prompt and returns a JSON response, which the frontend displays.

---

## 4. How is the AI model integrated?
**Answer:**
The backend uses the `@google/generative-ai` package. It sends a specially crafted prompt to the Gemini model and parses the JSON response for analysis.

---

## 5. How do you handle errors in the application?
**Answer:**
- Frontend: Checks for empty input, displays alerts, and shows user-friendly error messages if the backend is unreachable.
- Backend: Validates input, uses try-catch for async operations, and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

## 6. How is CORS handled?
**Answer:**
The backend uses the `cors` middleware to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend.

---

## 7. How is sensitive information like API keys managed?
**Answer:**
API keys are stored in environment variables using the `dotenv` package and are never exposed to the frontend.

---

## 8. How is the UI designed for user experience?
**Answer:**
The UI uses a modern, glassmorphic style with responsive design, clear feedback sections, and color-coded progress bars for easy interpretation.

---

## 9. What is the structure of the AI’s JSON response?
**Answer:**
The response includes:
- `overallPercentage` (0-100)
- `rating` (string)
- `categoryScores` (object with scores for communication, analysis, response, feedback, collaboration)
- `feedback` (object with strength, suggestion, and critical issue)

---

## 10. How would you improve this project in the future?
**Answer:**
- Add authentication and user history
- Support more prompt analysis categories
- Add export/share features
- Improve error handling and validation
- Add automated tests
